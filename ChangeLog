  Version 0.5.1
  [ Josh Triplett ]
  * Fix and rework prefix and etcdir handling to not embed the build directory
    in the binary.

  Version 0.5
  [ Josh Triplett ]
  * Improve handling for guarded commands that call other guarded commands: if
    called recursively (detected via MOLLYGUARD_CMD environment variable),
    unconditionally run the real command.  Suggested by Sam Hartman at
    DebConf.
  * Install the molly-guard wrapper script to lib/molly-guard in the prefix,
    to ensure that it's available on the same filesystem as the programs that
    link to it.
  * Support running the real utilities from a location other than /sbin,
    determined at build time by passing REALPATH to make.
  * Support setting an sbindir other than sbin in the prefix; this allows
    setting a prefix of /usr but an sbindir of /sbin.
  * Prevent gzip from interactively prompting about overwriting if
    molly-guard.8.gz already exists.

  Version 0.4.5
  [ Martin F. Krafft]
  * Use tty tool to detect the tty of stdin, rather than /proc/*/fd/0, which
    is Linux-specificy.

  [ Ludovico Gardenghi ]
  * Check the process tree from the shell up to init and look for a 'sshd'
    process.

  * Improved installation routine

2008-04-19 martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>

  Version 0.4
  * Checks are now done with run-parts to allow for easier extension.
  * Setting to simply always guard commands, bypassing checks.
  * Add ability to print custom warnings before the checks/prompt.

  Version 0.3.2
  * Don't fail if the SSH_CONNECTION variable is unset.

2008-03-12 martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>

  Version 0.3.1
  * Pass --short option to hostname to prevent the user from having to type
    the whole FQDN at times.
  * Check for the $SSH_CONNECTION variable in addition to the pty checks.
  * Add a basic REAMDE file.

  Version 0.3
  * Shield shutdown -h; I am terribly sorry, Andrew!
    Now only shutdown -c and * --help are passed through regardless.
  * Added --help option, which now prints a short molly-guard help message
    followed by the actual command's help output.
  * Now should also work in su/sudo sessions because it now checks whether the
    creator of the current tty/pts is sshd, rather than the brittle check for
    the environment. Thanks to Craig Small and Don Armstrong for their sparks
    of brilliance.
  * Added --pretend-ssh option to facilitate testing.
